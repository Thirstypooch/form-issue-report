# Image Optimization Instructions

The file `thirsty.png` needs to be optimized to reduce its file size. The current size is approximately 775 KB, which is quite large for a web image.

## Recommended Optimization Steps:

1. **Resize the image if necessary**:
   - The image is displayed with a max-width of 52 units in the application
   - Ensure the actual dimensions are appropriate for this display size (e.g., 200-300px width)

2. **Optimize the PNG**:
   - Use a tool like [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) or [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/) to compress the PNG
   - These tools can often reduce PNG file sizes by 60-80% without noticeable quality loss

3. **Consider converting to WebP**:
   - WebP format offers better compression than PNG while maintaining quality
   - If browser support allows, consider using WebP instead of PNG

4. **Target file size**:
   - Aim for a file size under 100 KB if possible
   - This will significantly improve page load times

5. **Replace the existing file**:
   - Once optimized, replace the existing `thirsty.png` file with the optimized version

## Example Command-line Optimization:

If you have ImageMagick installed, you can use:

```bash
# Resize and optimize
convert thirsty.png -resize 300x -strip -quality 85% thirsty_optimized.png

# Then replace the original
mv thirsty_optimized.png thirsty.png
```

Or using the `pngquant` tool:

```bash
pngquant --quality=65-80 thirsty.png --output thirsty_optimized.png
mv thirsty_optimized.png thirsty.png
```
